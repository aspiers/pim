# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Briefly, the idea is that when processing your inbox, for each email
# you have a maximum of two minutes to either:
#
#   - perform any actions required by that email, or
#
#   - add any such actions to your TODO list, and move the email out
#     of the inbox.  (Best practice is to move it to an archive folder
#     and have a system for rapid retrieval of the email via the TODO
#     list item, e.g. via a hyperlink which will retrieve the email
#     based on its Message-Id: header, using an indexing mail search
#     engine.)
#
# This simple timer program constantly monitors the number of emails
# in the given maildir folder, and shows you how much of the two
# minutes you have left to process the item you are currently looking
# at.  Once you exceed the two minute budget, it will start beeping to
# prod you to adhere to the rule.
#
# So for example if you have 30 mails in your inbox, using this timer
# it should take you an absolute maximum of one hour to process them
# all ("process" in the sense defined within David Allen's GTD
# system).
#
# For mutt users, this approach can work nicely in conjunction with
#
#   https://github.com/aspiers/mutt.pub/blob/master/.mutt/common.d/96-GTD-FIFO
#
# which helps focus on a single mail thread at a time.
